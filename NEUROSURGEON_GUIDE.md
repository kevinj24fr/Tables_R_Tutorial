### **Option 2: R Commander (GUI Alternative)**
A menu-driven interface that lets you analyze data without writing code.

**Why R Commander?**
- No coding required
- Familiar menu structure
- Built-in statistical tests
- Visual output

**Getting R Commander:**
```r
# In R or RStudio, type:
install.packages("Rcmdr")
library(Rcmdr)
```

### **Option 3: Jamovi (Modern GUI)**
A free, modern statistical software with a beautiful interface.

**Why Jamovi?**
- Completely visual interface

## **R Basics**

### **Think of R Like Medical Terminology**

| R Concept | Medical Equivalent | What It Means |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Variable** | Patient characteristic | Age, tumor grade, survival time |
| **Data frame** | Patient chart | All your patients' data in one place |
| **Function** | Medical procedure | A standardized way to do something |
| **Package** | Medical specialty | A collection of related tools |
| **Script** | Treatment protocol | Step-by-step instructions |

### **Essential R Commands (Like Medical Abbreviations)**

```r
# Loading your data (like opening a patient chart)
data <- read_excel("Data/ClinicalData.xlsx")

# Looking at your data (like reviewing patient list)
View(data)
head(data)

# Basic statistics (like vital signs)
summary(data$Age)
table(data$Grade)

# Creating a plot (like an MRI image)
plot(data$Age, data$OS)
```

### **Common R Errors and Solutions**

| Error Message | What It Means | How to Fix |
|---------------|---------------|------------|
| "Object not found" | You're looking for something that doesn't exist | Check spelling, make sure you loaded your data |
| "Unexpected symbol" | R doesn't understand your syntax | Check for missing commas, parentheses, or quotes |
| "Package not found" | You're trying to use a tool that isn't installed | Run the setup script first |

## **Clinical Workflow: Step-by-Step**

### **Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment**
```r
# Run this first (like washing your hands before surgery)
source("R/setup.R")
```

**What this does:**
- Installs all necessary tools
- Loads required packages
- Checks your R version
- Prepares your workspace

### **Step 2: Loading Your Data**
```r
# Load your clinical data (like opening a patient's chart)
data <- read_excel("Data/ClinicalData.xlsx")

# Check what you have (like reviewing patient demographics)
dim(data)  # How many patients and variables
names(data)  # What variables you have
```

### **Step 3: Understanding Your Data**
```r
# Basic overview (like a patient summary)
summary(data)

# Look at specific variables (like checking vital signs)
table(data$Grade)  # Tumor grade distribution
table(data$IDH_mutation_status)  # IDH status
```

### **Step 4: Running Your First Analysis**
```r
# Start with Lesson 1 (like starting with basic procedures)
source("R/Lesson1.R")
```

## **Common Clinical Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: "I want to compare survival between IDH mutant and wildtype patients"**

**Traditional Approach**: Send data to biostatistician, wait weeks
**With This Resource**: 
```r
# Run Lesson 6
source("R/Lesson6.R")
# Results: IDH wildtype patients have 1.83x higher risk of death (p = 0.002)
```

### **Scenario 2: "I want to see if age affects survival in my glioblastoma patients"**

**Traditional Approach**: Complex statistical consultation
**With This Resource**:
```r
# Run Lesson 6
source("R/Lesson6.R")
# Results: Age increases risk by 1.01x per year (p = 0.11)
```

### **Scenario 3: "I want to create a figure for my paper showing survival by grade"**

**Traditional Approach**: Request from graphics department
**With This Resource**:
```r
# Run Lesson 6
source("R/Lesson6.R")
# Results: Publication-ready Kaplan-Meier plot generated
```

## **Troubleshooting**

### **"I'm getting an error message"**
1. **Don't panic** - errors are normal, even for experienced users
2. **Copy the exact error message** into Google
3. **Check the troubleshooting guide**: `docs/troubleshooting.md`
4. **Try the setup script again**: `source("R/setup.R")`

### **"The script isn't working"**
1. **Check your working directory** - make sure you're in the right folder
2. **Verify your data file** - ensure `Data/ClinicalData.xlsx` exists
3. **Run setup first** - always start with `source("R/setup.R")`
4. **Check R version** - make sure you have R 4.0 or higher

### **"I don't understand the output"**
1. **Focus on p-values** - < 0.05 means statistically significant
2. **Look for clinical interpretation** - each lesson explains results
3. **Check the documentation** - `docs/clinical_stats_guide.md`
4. **Start with basic lessons** - build understanding gradually
