Clinical Dataset Overview

This dataset, originally saved as `ClinicalData.xlsx`, is used throughout this repository to teach core concepts in clinical and survival analysis using R.

It contains CGGA patient data, with various clinical and molecular features.

Dataset Contents

Each row represents a unique patient. The columns include:

| Column Name                     | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| `CGGA_ID`                      | Unique patient identifier |
| `PRS_type`                     | Tumor type: Primary or Recurrent |
| `Histology`                    | Tumor histology (e.g., AA, A, O) |
| `Grade`                        | WHO Grade (II, III, IV) |
| `Gender`                       | Patient gender |
| `Age`                          | Age at diagnosis (in years) |
| `Age_Bin`                      | Binned age (e.g., 40.0 for ≤ 40) |
| `OS`                           | Overall survival (in days) |
| `Censor`                       | Survival event status: 0 = alive, 1 = dead |
| `Radio_status`                | Radiotherapy status: 1 = treated, 0 = untreated |
| `Chemo_status`                | Chemotherapy (TMZ) status: 1 = treated, 0 = untreated |
| `IDH_mutation_status`         | Mutation status: Mutant or Wildtype |
| `1p19q_codeletion_status`     | Codeletion status: Codel or Non-codel |
| `MGMTp_methylation_status`    | MGMT promoter methylation: methylated or un-methylated |

Usage in Lessons

This dataset is used in:

- Data import and cleaning
- Visualization of clinical variables
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, Cox models)
- Hypothesis testing and regression modeling

Notes
	•	Some columns may contain missing values and require cleaning.
	•	Ensure proper encoding of categorical variables (as factor) before statistical analysis.
	•	Data is provided for educational use only.
