# Clinical Data Analysis in R: A Guided Learning Series

Welcome to the **Clinical Data Analysis in R** repository!  
This curated collection of R scripts is designed to help you build strong foundations in clinical and biomedical data analysis using the R programming language. This series provides a complete, structured learning path from basic visualization to multivariable modeling.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial series, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Set up your R environment and import clinical data
- Clean and prepare real-world datasets
- Explore and visualize distributions and relationships
- Perform survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests
- Build multivariable Cox regression models
- Test associations with Chi-square and Fisher's Exact tests
- Compare continuous outcomes with Wilcoxon and t-tests
- Model binary outcomes with logistic regression
- Interpret correlation matrices for numeric features

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open each `LessonXX.R` script in RStudio or your R environment
3. Run each section line by line while reading the comments and completing practice tasks
4. Modify the code and experiment with your own questions and visualizations

## ðŸ“Œ Requirements

- R (v4.0 or higher recommended)
- R packages: `readxl`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `survival`, `survminer`, `ggpubr`, `corrplot`, `rstatix`, `car`, `psych`, etc.

You can install all necessary packages with:

```r
required_packages <- c("readxl", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "tidyr", 
                       "survival", "survminer", "ggpubr", "corrplot", 
                       "rstatix", "car", "psych")
install.packages(setdiff(required_packages, rownames(installed.packages())))
```

## Learning Format

Each lesson includes:
	â€¢	Concept explanations
	â€¢	Commented code
	â€¢	Practice tasks to reinforce learning
	â€¢	Suggestions for customization

Spend around 30â€“60 minutes per lesson to get the most value â€” thatâ€™s a full 8â€“10 hour self-paced course!
